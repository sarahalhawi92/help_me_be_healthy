	<h2>What do I need to know about vitamins?</h2>

	<p>Vitamins are organic compounds that are necessary for normal growth and maintenance of life. Thirteen essential vitamins have been isolated and these are divided into two categories, water-soluble and fat-soluble vitamins. The water-soluble vitamins include Vitamin C and the group of B-Vitamins. These water-soluble are not stored by the body and can be readily depleted. The fat-soluble vitamins A, D, and E remain in the body for longer periods of time. </p>

	<h2>What do I need to know about minerals?</h2>

	<p>Minerals are essential for human metabolism. They are involved in responses of the nervous system and muscles, the absorption and secretions of the body's fluids, and maintain a delicate water balance within the body. The bones and teeth of our body have high mineral contents which accounts for their hardness and rigidity.</p>
